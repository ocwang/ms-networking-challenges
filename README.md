Monday Challenges

You'll be creating a simple iOS app that display's all of today's featured products on Product Hunt. To learn more about Apple's native API's for dealing with networking, you won't be using any third-party libraries to build this app.

While building this app, you must complete the following objectives:

1. Create a URL using the string initializer. Create unit tests to verify the URL scheme, host, path, and absolute string.

2. Create a relative URL from a base URL. 

3. Add a query item using URLComponents. Why would we want to create URLs using base URLs, relative paths, and URLComponents?

4. Make a network request to fetch all of today's featured products on PH.

5. Deserialize the data that's returned with flatMap and a failable initializer.

6. Display the returned data in a table view.

7. Create a button to vote and unvote a product.
